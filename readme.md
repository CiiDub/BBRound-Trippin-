# BBRound Trippin‚Äô
## Open files with the ```bbedit``` cli-tool from the server.

[BBEdit](https://www.barebones.com/products/bbedit/) is a stalwart commercial text editor for the Macintosh computer.

It offers a [Command-line tool](https://www.barebones.com/products/bbedit/benefitscommand.html#commandline): __bbedit__. This script invokes it over SSH.

Use it in a very similar way as you would with local files:

- ```Server_Prompt$ rtedit file.txt``` --> _opens file.txt._

- ```Server_Prompt$ rtedit .``` --> _opens BBEdit‚Äôs sftp browser to the current directory._

- ```Server_Prompt$ rtedit ~``` --> _opens BBEdit‚Äôs sftp browser to the home directory._

- ```Server_Prompt$ rtedit /etc``` --> _opens BBEdit‚Äôs sftp browser to the etc directory._

Including pipes and flags:

- ```Server_Prompt$ man seq | col -b | rtedit --view-top -m "unix-man-page"``` --> _Opens the manual for __seq__ in BBedit with the language set to Unix man page and the window scrolled to the top._

## Install and configure.

1) Copy shell script __rtedit__ to a server you can configure. *If you rename the script bbedit the command will look exactly like their local version*

1) Place in a dir accessable by the users __PATH__. Such as __/usr/local/bin__.

1) Make the script executable.

1) Set env variable __BB_USER__ to your username on the client mac.

1) Set env variable __BB_HOST__ to the hostname of the client mac. -*This is optional* 

## Admissions, assumptions, concerns, and more configurations.

I am not a security expert, so weigh my advice and the use of this script accordingly. BBRound Trippin‚Äô exploits remote access to the server and to your client.

There are a lot of scripts like this in forums on the internet, and probably more on GitHub as well. The truth is I worry a little bit about how people are using them and if they are putting enough effort in isolating the users credentials.

I‚Äôd like to offer a setup that is at least reasonable, if not diligent.

- I‚Äôm assuming you have access to configure SSH on the server, and your client mac of course.

- I‚Äôm not going to cover how to call back to your mac client from across the internet or navigate your local firewall, router, vpn etc.

- I‚Äôm also betting you know a little about SSH key authentication. 

- Finally, you should be familiar with the command line, and setting env variables.


### The breakdown.
1) Your client computer is a mac (with BBEdit installed) opening an SSH session with a Unix style server.

1) When you open a file with```Server_Prompt$ rtedit file_name.txt``` the script sends a properly formatted command with parameters back to your mac via SSH.

1) Now BBEdit opens __file_name.txt__ via it‚Äôs own SSH (sftp) connections, leaving you with two mac to server connections; one from your terminal, the other from BBEdit.

It‚Äôs that second step ü§®; keep an eye on it.

Here is what the command would look like typed out manually:
```bash
Server_Prompt$ ssh userC@my_macintosh.local bbedit "sftp://userS@my_server.local"
```

## Declaring your BB environment variables on the server.
__~/.bash_profile__

```bash
# SSH environment
if [ "$SSH_CONNECTION" ]
then
	export BB_USER="userC"
	export BB_HOST="mymacurl.net"	
fi
```

### Your mac is your safe place, maybe.

Try and configure as much as possible in your local SSH and shell environments. Even hardcoding your username can be avoided.

This primarily means setting __BB\_USER__ and __BB\_HOST__ localling rather than on the server.

Your hostname/ip can be surmised on from your SSH connection, so __BB\_HOST__ is optional, even though I set it manually in all my examples.

#### First declare them locally:
__~/.bash_profile__

```bash
# Here be rtedit variables for ssh connections
export BB_USER="userC"
export BB_HOST="$(hostname)"	
```

There are a number of ways to setup BB\_HOST. On most macs ‚Äú$(hostname)‚Äù will expand to something like my\_macintosh.local. You can configure your hostname in the Sharing preference panel. This is great because it avoids using your mac‚Äôs ip, which is probably changing all the time.

You also might set a domain like back\_to\_me\_domain.net if you want to point back at your mac from outside your network.

#### Send the variables to your SSH session:

You have to first configure the server.
Add this line to your __/etc/ssh/sshd_config__ on the server:

```
AcceptEnv BB_USER BB_HOST
```

This does increase your servers surface area for attack. I think this is reasonable as long as you are not leaving the door wide open and declaring the specific variables you will allow. The upside is that you haven‚Äôt put any info about your Mac on the server. It lives and dies with that specific SSH connection. Tradeoffs, security is hard.

Lets setup a __~.ssh/config__ on your mac

```
Host the_server
	HostName my_server.local
	User userS
	SendEnv BB_USER BB_HOST
```

Now when you ```ssh the_server```it will add __BB\_USER__ and __BB\_HOST__ to that sessions environment.

#### An alternative to declaring __BB\_USER__ and __BB\_HOST__ in your local environment.

OpenSSH added the configuration `SetEnv` in late 2018. You can check `man ssh_config` to see if your version supports it. It‚Äôs a better option as you can configure BBRound Trippn‚Äô in __~.ssh/config__ on a host by host basis.

```
Host local_server
	HostName my_server.local
	User userS
	SetEnv BB_USER=userC BB_HOST=my_macintosh.local
	SendEnv BB_USER BB_HOST

Host remote_server
	HostName my_server.net
	User userRS
	SetEnv BB_USER=userC BB_HOST=back_to_me_domain.net
	SendEnv BB_USER BB_HOST
```

#### Authentication and the SSH Agent:

[Don‚Äôt use a password](https://medium.com/macoclock/set-up-ssh-on-macos-89e8354d8b63
), and have only one set of keys.

You should have an SSH key pair set up in order to login to your server.

You don‚Äôt want to make a set of keys on the server, but you have to make an SSH connection back to your mac. You can use Agent Forwarding to to safely pass your private key from your mac to your server and back to your mac.

Add your public key to __~/.ssh/authorized_keys__

Set up your __~.ssh/config__ like so.

```
Host the_server
	HostName my_server.local
	User userS
	SetEnv BB_USER=userC BB_HOST=my_macintosh.local
	SendEnv BB_USER BB_HOST
	AddKeysToAgent yes
	IdentityFile ~/.ssh/<private_key>
	ForwardAgent yes
```

That‚Äôs it, everything should work and you haven‚Äôt hard coded any sensitive information about your mac on the server.
